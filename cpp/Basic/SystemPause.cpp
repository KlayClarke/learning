//// what is system("pause")?
//// - function that tells os to pause execution of parent system
//// why is it considered bad practice?
//// - only works for windows os (I tried and was wondering why it wouldn't work)
//// use cin.get() instead - works on multi platforms or can add breakpoint to end of main func
//
//#include <iostream>
//
//int main()
//{
//	std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
//	std::cin.get();
//}
